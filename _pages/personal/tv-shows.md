A list of shows that I've either watched or are in the middle of watching.
Next to each show is an indication of how many episodes I've watched.
No episode number indicates that I've watched the entire season.
The phrase *in progress* indicates that I've either forgotten how far into the show I am,
or I am watching the episodes out of order (as is the case for Black Mirror).
