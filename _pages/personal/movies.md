A list of movies that I've watched and a list of them that I've been meaning to watch.
I've decided to include movies that I've watched before starting this list in a separate list... which I'm afraid will be in a never-ending state of being incomplete and potentially inaccurate.
Documentaries are included but will be labeled with a `(d)`.
Movies with common names might be succeeded with the year it was released.

**2020-12-30** Started the list.

## To Watch
<ul>
  {%- for movie in page.movies.to_watch -%}
