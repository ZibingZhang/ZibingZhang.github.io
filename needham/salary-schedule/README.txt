The Needham School Committee and the Needham Education Association have contractual agreements with the following employee units:

Unit A Contract
Most professionally licensed staff are part of Unit A including teachers, counselors, nurses, school psychologists, speech pathologists, etc..

It is important to note that individuals who have prior licensed experience in a public school district, charter school or state-approved special education school will receive credit for that experience on the Needham salary scale. Those candidates who come with experience in a private, parochial or independent school will be given half credit for each year of service. It is the policy of the Needham Public Schools to allow credit for clinical experience only when performed a school setting as described previously.

The Needham Public School's collectively bargained salary scale, like many public schools, is designed to compensate employees based on years of service and educational credentials. It is important to note that graduate credit beyond the Master's degree (Master's +15, 30, 45 and 60) must be earned after the date that your degree has been awarded on your transcript.

Many clinical degree programs (speech pathologists, psychologists, social workers, etc.) require more credit than is typical for a Master's degree in teaching. While the Needham Public Schools appreciates the additional work that is required by your institution to complete the degree, no additional credit on the salary scale will be awarded for any credit that is required as part of a Master's program. Again, credit beyond the Master's degree will only be recognized after the date of your Master's degree was awarded.
