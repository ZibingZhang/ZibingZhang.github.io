This recipe was heavily inspired by [this](https://www.wellplated.com/chickpea-tuna-salad/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} one.

## Nutritional Information
Quinoa is a [complete protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_protein){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, meaning that it contains all nine essential amino acids.[^1]
It is a good source of protein and fiber.[^1]

Chickpeas are "an excellent source of carbohydrates, protein, fiber, B vitamins, and some minerals."[^2]
They provide a plethora of health benefits when "eaten as part of balanced plant-rich diet."[^2]

Canned tuna is a good protein option that has little fat.
It also contains omega-3 fatty acids, the benefits of which seem to be widely debated, but is generally accepted to be good for the heart.[^3] [^4]

## Ingredients
### For the Salad
- 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 19 oz canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 10 oz cherry tomatoes, halved
- 12 oz light canned tuna in water
- 8.5 oz cooked quinoa
- 5 oz arugula
- feta cheese, to taste

### For the Dressing
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- salt, to taste
- pepper, to taste
- extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions
1. Combine the arugula, quinoa, cherry tomatoes, red onion, and tuna in a large bowl.
2. Combine the dressing in a separate bowl.
3. Pan fry chickpeas on medium heat with salt and pepper, adding in the dressing near the end, until mildly toasted.
4. Add the chickpeas to the salad and mix thoroughly.
5. Add feta cheese, salt, and pepper to taste.

## Cooking Process

There was not much to do in terms of cooking.
Most of the ingredients are combined raw.
I did cheat a little and bought precooked quinoa.
I am personally not a huge fan of salads, but it turned out a lot better than I expected.
