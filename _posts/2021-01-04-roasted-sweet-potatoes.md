## Nutritional Information
Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is a root vegetable with ample amounts of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.[^1]
Bolstering the immune system and reduce inflammation are just a couple of its many health benefits.[^1]
It has a fairly high glycemic index (GI) of 94.[^2]

## Ingredients
- 1 sweet potato, medium, peeled, cut into chunks
- *optional*: 1 carrot, peeled, cut into large dice chunks
- *optional*: 1 parsnip, peeled, cut into large dice chunks
- 1 tbsp (15ml) of olive oil
- *optional*: 1 sprig rosemary
- 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt, or to taste
- 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder, or to taste
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425&deg; (220&deg;C).
2. Place all vegetables in a large mixing bowl and toss with olive oil, rosemary, salt, and pepper.
3. Place on baking sheet pan, spread out evenly.
4. Place in middle of oven and roast until fork-tender, about 45 minutes.

## Notes
- Make sure all vegetables are cut roughly the same size to ensure even cooking.
- Cooking time may vary depending on the size of the chunks.

## Substitutions
- Sweet potato can be substituted with cassava root or any other root vegetable.
- Olive oil can be substituted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil.

## Cooking Process
~~This recipe has been passed down through my mother's side of the family for generations.
Even today, I can fondly remember my mother cooking this recipe for me after I came down with the flu in the second grade.~~

I decided to double the recipe since I had more than enough ingredients at home.

### Preparing the Ingredients
{% include gallery layout="half" id="preparing_ingredients" %}

Preparing the ingredients did not take much effort at all.

I had some extra carrots lying around, so I decided to add a couple of them into the mix.
Since I was unable to find fresh rosemary, I was forced to substitute it with dried rosemary instead.

Washing the vegetables removed more dirt than I had expected... it has been a while since I have properly cooked.
I was pleasantly surprised to find a little *thing* at the end of the peeler, as we had previously discussed in class, used to gouge out portions of the sweet potato.
Halving the sweet potato was unexpected difficult, but after that dicing it was very straightforward.

### Combining the Ingredients
{% include gallery id="combining_ingredients" %}

While I measured the olive oil, I eyeballed the salt, pepper, and rosemary and hoped for the best.
Measuring would have taken more effort than I was willing to spend.
I think I did a decent job.

### Roasting
{% include gallery id="roasting" %}

I did not want to crowd the pan too much, so I split the batch between two pans.
One I sprinkled with a bit of dried rosemary, the other I did not.
In the end, however, I combined both pans onto a single plate... so I am not sure if it really mattered in the end.

### End Result
{% include gallery id="end_result" %}

~~I was able to apply some of the techniques I learned from [this](http://academic-catalog.massart.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=10&coid=9246){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} illustration course to my plating.~~

I think my first attempt at this recipe turned out alright.
In the future, I will try to keep a closer eye on the progress so that I will be better able to judge when it is done cooking.
