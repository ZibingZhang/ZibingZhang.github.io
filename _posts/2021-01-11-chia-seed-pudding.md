It takes about 5 minutes tops to make this recipe.
I will definitely make a few times next semester for breakfast.
After not reading the original instructions fully, I poured all the oat milk in followed by the chia seeds.
To my surprise, the chia seeds all remained floating at the top which made mixing the seeds into the milk much difficult than anticipated.
Next time I will be sure to layer the milk and the chia seeds.

I expected it to look at least somewhat different after taking it out of the fridge, but alas it looks exactly the same... which means there is no *after* photo.
The texture did change a lot though.
It changed from a very liquid texture to a more gelatinous one.
