<blockquote>
  <p>
    Anyone can love a thing <i>because</i>. 
    That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket.
    But to love something <i>despite</i> 
    To know the flaws and love them too. 
    That is rare and pure and perfect.
  </p>

    The day we fret about the future is the day we leave our childhood behind.
